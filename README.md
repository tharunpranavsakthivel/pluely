# Features

## Invisibility Mode

Pluely operates with complete stealth during sensitive scenarios. The application features a translucent overlay window that sits above all other applications, making it invisible in video calls, screen shares, and recordings. The window is designed to be screenshot-proof and undetectable in meeting platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and Slack Huddles. When sharing your screen or recording, Pluely remains invisible to your audience while providing you with real-time AI assistance.

## System Audio Capture

Capture and transcribe system audio in real-time. The system audio feature allows you to record audio directly from your computer's output, perfect for meetings, presentations, or any audio playing on your system. The captured audio is processed through your selected speech-to-text provider and can be automatically sent to the AI for analysis or transcription.

**Keyboard Shortcut:** `Cmd+Shift+M` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+M` (Windows/Linux)

The system audio capture includes voice activity detection, real-time audio visualization, and automatic processing status indicators. Configure your preferred audio input devices in the Audio Settings page.

## Voice Input

Record your voice and convert it to text using advanced speech-to-text providers. The voice input feature supports multiple STT providers including OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, Groq Whisper, and custom providers. Voice activity detection automatically identifies when you're speaking and processes your audio accordingly.

**Keyboard Shortcut:** `Cmd+Shift+A` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux)

Voice input can be used in the main overlay window or within chat conversations for hands-free interaction with AI.

## Screenshot Capture

Capture screenshots and send them to AI for visual analysis. Pluely offers two screenshot modes:

**Screenshot Mode:** Capture the entire screen with a single click. The full screen is captured instantly and can be processed by AI.

**Selection Mode:** Click and drag to select a specific area of your screen to capture. This mode allows precise control over what you want the AI to analyze.

**Keyboard Shortcut:** `Cmd+Shift+S` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+S` (Windows/Linux)

**Processing Modes:**

**Manual Mode:** Screenshots are captured and automatically added to your attached files. You can capture multiple screenshots and submit them later with your own prompt. This gives you full control over when and how screenshots are sent to the AI.

**Auto Mode:** Screenshots are automatically submitted to AI using your custom prompt. Configure a default prompt in Screenshot Settings that will be used every time a screenshot is captured. Only one screenshot can be submitted at a time in auto mode, providing instant AI analysis without manual intervention.

Configure your preferred screenshot mode and processing behavior in the Screenshot Settings page.

## File Attachments

Attach files to your AI conversations for analysis, review, or context. Pluely supports attaching multiple files at once, allowing you to send documents, images, code files, or any text-based content to the AI. Files are displayed as chips with file type indicators and can be removed individually or cleared all at once.

Drag and drop files directly into the input area, or use the file attachment button to browse and select files from your system. Attached files are processed and sent alongside your text prompt to provide context for AI responses.

# Pluely Dashboard

The Pluely Dashboard provides comprehensive access to all features and settings through an intuitive sidebar navigation. Access the dashboard using the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+D` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Shift+D` (Windows/Linux).

- Delete conversations you no longer need

The view page supports continuous chat, allowing you to maintain context across multiple messages with the AI. All messages display with user and AI avatars, proper formatting, and timestamps grouped by date.

## System Prompts

Create, manage, and organize custom system prompts to control AI behavior. System prompts define how the AI responds and behaves across all interactions. The page displays all prompts in a grid layout with search functionality to quickly find specific prompts.

**Features:**

- Create new system prompts with custom names and instructions
- Edit existing prompts to refine AI behavior
- Delete prompts you no longer need
- Select active prompt that will be used for all AI interactions
- Search prompts by name or content

- `{{SYSTEM_PROMPT}}` - System instructions
- `{{MODEL}}` - AI model name
- `{{API_KEY}}` - API authentication key

**Example Custom Provider:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{API_KEY}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "{{MODEL}}",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "{{SYSTEM_PROMPT}}"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "{{TEXT}}"}
    ]
  }'
```

**STT Providers:**

Configure speech-to-text providers from pre-configured services including OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs STT, Groq Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, Deepgram, Azure Speech-to-Text, Speechmatics, Rev.ai, and IBM Watson STT.

**Custom STT Provider Setup:**

Add any speech-to-text provider using curl commands with complete control:

1. Enter your curl command with the API endpoint and audio data structure
2. Configure authentication and headers
3. Specify the response path to extract transcription text (e.g., `text` or `results[0].transcript`)
4. Support for various audio formats and sample rates
5. Create custom variables for flexible configuration

**Dynamic Variables for STT:**

- `{{AUDIO}}` - Audio file or blob data
- `{{API_KEY}}` - API authentication key
- `{{LANGUAGE}}` - Target transcription language
- Custom variables you define in your curl command

**Example Custom STT Provider:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {{API_KEY}}" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "file={{AUDIO}}" \
  -F "model=whisper-1"
```

The Dev Space allows complete flexibility to integrate any AI or STT service that exposes a REST API, giving you unlimited options beyond pre-configured providers.

## Why Pluely?

Pluely redefines what an AI assistant can be. Built from the ground up with privacy, performance, and discretion in mind, it delivers enterprise-grade capabilities without compromising your data security or system resources.

## Complete Invisibility

Pluely operates with absolute stealth. The application features a translucent overlay window that sits seamlessly above all other applications, making it invisible to everyone except you.

**Undetectable Everywhere:**

The overlay window is designed to be invisible in video calls, screen shares, recordings, and screenshots. When you share your screen in Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or any other meeting platform, Pluely remains completely hidden from your audience. The translucent design makes it extremely difficult to capture in screenshots, and it won't appear on projectors or shared screens.

**Perfect Stealth Design:**

The window transparency can be adjusted to your preference, allowing you to see through it while keeping it functional. You can instantly show or hide the window using keyboard shortcuts, and move it anywhere on your screen with arrow keys. The always-on-top mode ensures it's accessible when you need it, while the hide feature makes it disappear completely when you don't.

**Critical Use Cases:**

Use Pluely confidently during job interviews to get real-time information without detection. Access product details instantly during sales calls while maintaining professionalism. Reference documentation during technical meetings without breaking your flow. Get learning assistance during educational presentations that's completely invisible to your audience. Analyze screenshots and get suggestions during design reviews without anyone knowing. Debug code and get syntax help during live coding sessions in complete stealth.

## Privacy-First Architecture

Your data stays yours. Pluely is engineered with privacy as the foundation, not an afterthought.

**Local Storage:**

All your conversations are stored locally in a SQLite database on your device. Chat history, messages, and attachments never leave your computer. The database is stored in your application data directory with full transaction safety and data integrity checks. Your conversations can be exported as markdown files and deleted anytime you want.

**Settings and Configuration:**

All application settings, AI provider configurations, custom system prompts, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences are stored in your browser's localStorage. This data remains on your device and is never transmitted anywhere. You have complete control over your configuration data.

**Secure Credentials:**

License keys and sensitive credentials are stored in encrypted secure storage in your application data directory, separate from other application data. API keys for AI providers are stored in localStorage and never sent to any server except directly to your chosen AI provider.

**Zero Server Dependency:**

Pluely makes API calls directly from your device to your chosen AI provider. There are no proxy servers, no middleware, and no data collection. Your conversations go straight from your device to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or whichever provider you choose. You can inspect every network request in your browser's developer tools to verify this claim.

**No Telemetry:**

Pluely has no analytics, no usage tracking, no data collection, and no telemetry of any kind. Your usage patterns, conversations, and behavior remain completely private. The application doesn't phone home, doesn't report statistics, and doesn't collect any information about how you use it.

**Offline Capability:**

The application works without an internet connection for all local features. You only need internet when making API calls to AI providers for responses. Everything else, including the interface, settings, chat history, and system prompts, works completely offline.

## Blazing Fast Performance

Built with Tauri and Rust, Pluely delivers native desktop performance that puts web-based alternatives to shame.

**Lightweight Binary:**

The entire application is approximately 10MB in size, making it 27 times smaller than the original Cluely and significantly smaller than Electron-based alternatives. Despite its tiny footprint, it includes a full React frontend, Rust backend, SQLite database, and all features.

**Instant Startup:**

Pluely launches in under 100 milliseconds. There's no splash screen, no loading spinner, and no waiting. Click the icon and it's ready to use immediately. This instant startup makes it perfect for quick queries and impromptu assistance.

**Native Performance:**

Built on Tauri, Pluely runs as a native application using your system's webview. There's no embedded Chromium, no browser overhead, and no unnecessary resource consumption. It uses 50% less RAM compared to Electron apps and has minimal CPU impact even during active use.

**Efficient Resource Usage:**

The application typically uses less than 50MB of RAM during normal operation. System audio capture, voice recording, and screenshot processing are optimized for performance. Multiple conversations, attached files, and chat history don't slow down the application.

**Cross-Platform:**

Pluely runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux with platform-specific optimizations. The same codebase delivers optimal performance on all three platforms, using native system APIs and respecting platform conventions.

## Complete Control

Own your AI experience. Pluely gives you unprecedented control over every aspect of the application.

**Any AI Provider:**

Connect to any LLM provider using simple curl commands. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Mistral, Cohere, Perplexity, Groq, Ollama, or your own custom endpoint. Switch providers anytime without losing your chat history or configuration. Use multiple providers for different use cases.

**Any STT Provider:**

Integrate any speech-to-text service using curl commands. OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, Groq, Deepgram, Azure, Google, or custom providers. Full control over audio format, sample rate, and processing parameters. Test providers instantly to find the best accuracy for your voice and language.

**Custom System Prompts:**

Create unlimited system prompts to control AI behavior. Define personas, writing styles, response formats, and specialized knowledge domains. Switch between prompts instantly to adapt the AI to different scenarios. Use AI-powered generation to create effective prompts automatically.

**Flexible Configuration:**

Customize keyboard shortcuts for all actions. Adjust window transparency and always-on-top behavior. Configure screenshot capture modes and processing options. Set response length, language, and auto-scroll preferences. Choose audio input devices and capture settings. Everything is configurable to match your workflow.

**Open Source:**

The entire codebase is open source under GPL v3. You can inspect every line of code, verify privacy claims, audit security measures, and modify the application to suit your needs. Build it yourself, contribute improvements, or fork it for custom requirements.

## Always Ready

Pluely sits quietly on your desktop, consuming minimal resources while remaining instantly accessible.

**One-Click Access:**

Use keyboard shortcuts to instantly show or hide the window, open the dashboard, start voice recording, capture screenshots, or toggle system audio. The overlay window is always available when you need it and out of sight when you don't.

**Persistent History:**

All conversations are saved locally in SQLite with full context. Return to previous conversations anytime, continue where you left off, and search through your history. Export conversations as markdown for documentation or reference.

**Background Operation:**

Pluely can run silently in the background with the overlay hidden. Enable autostart to launch it automatically when your system boots. Hide the dock icon for maximum stealth while keeping the application running and accessible via keyboard shortcuts.

**Zero Maintenance:**

No subscriptions to manage, no accounts to maintain, and no services to configure beyond your AI provider. Once set up, Pluely just works. Updates are delivered automatically when available, and you control when to install them.
